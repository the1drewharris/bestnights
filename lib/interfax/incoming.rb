  # = Interfax::Incoming
  #
  # Allows interaction with the Interfax Inbound API, documented at:
  # http://www.interfax.net/en/dev/webservice/reference_in
  #
  # == Retrieving incoming faxes
  #
  # Set the +username+ and +password+ variables appropriately, and
  # then call one of the query methods, which are described in further
  # detail below.
  # 
  #   Interfax::Incoming.username = 'my_interfax_username'
  #   Interfax::Incoming.password = 'my_interfax_password'
  #   faxes = Interfax::Incoming.unread
  #
  # You can extend Interfax::Incoming, and the query methdos will
  # return instances of your subclass. This is useful for extending
  # functionality, or consolidating your configuration in one place.
  #
  #   class InboundFax < Interfax::Incoming
  #     self.username = 'my_interfax_username'
  #     self.password = 'my_interfax_password'
  #
  #     def write_image_to_file
  #       File.open("/path/to/file", 'w') { |f| f.write(image)
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  #   faxes = InboundFax.all # this is an array of InboundFax objects
  #   faxes.map(&:write_image_to_file)
  #
  # == Methods
  #
  # The methods available for fetching or querying inbound faxes are:
  #
  # * +#all+ - Retrieves all inbound faxes, up to +limit+.
  # * +#unread+ - Retrieves any unread faxes, up to +limit+.
  # * +#account_all+ - Retrieves inbound faxes for all users on your
  #   account, up to +limit+. Requires an administrator account.
  # * +#account_unread+ - Same as above, but fetches only unread
  #   faxes. Also requires an administrator account.
  #
  # As seen above, these methods return instances of the class they're
  # called on, which makes it easy to extend your objects for custom
  # functionality. 
  #
  # == Configuration
  #
  # We require that the following two configuration variables be set
  # at the class level, as seen in the examples above.
  #
  # * +username+ - [required] Your interfax username.
  # * +password+ - [requierd] Your interfax password.
  #
  # We also support a few other configuration methods, which are
  # explained further in Interfax's API documentation.
  #
  # * +limit+ - [1..100, default 100] The maximum number of faxes to return.
  # * +mark_as_read+ - [boolean, default false] Whether or not to mark
  #   retrieved faxes as sent.
  #
  # These options are also accepted as options when requesting faxes:
  #
  #   # Assume username/password already set
  #   Interfax::Incoming.all(:limit => 10, :mark_as_read => true)
  #
  # Options supplied this way will temporarily override any options
  # set on the class.
